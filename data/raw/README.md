# Raw Data Folder

This folder is intended to store the raw data used in the project. However, due to the nature of the ISRUC-Sleep dataset, the actual data cannot be stored directly in this repository.

## Dataset Information

The ISRUC-Sleep dataset is a comprehensive polysomnographic (PSG) dataset designed to assist researchers in sleep studies. It includes data obtained from adult participants, both healthy and those with sleep disorders. The dataset is structured into three groups:

1. Data from 100 subjects, each with one recording session.
2. Data from 8 subjects, each with two recording sessions to support longitudinal studies.
3. Data from 10 healthy subjects, each with one recording session to facilitate comparison studies.

All PSG recordings were visually scored by two sleep experts and include electrophysiological, pneumological, and contextual information.

## Accessing the Dataset
